          <h2>Beyond the Bottle</h2>
          <p>
            TEARS is more than a condiment it’s a culinary companion designed to
            elevate every kind of dish and every kind of cook. Whether it’s a
            home kitchen experiment or a professional chef’s plating, our sauces
            adapt effortlessly, enhancing flavor without overpowering it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each variant is carefully developed to serve multiple purposes as a
            drizzle, dip, stir-fry base, marinade, or coating embodying
            versatility in every sense. From smoky notes to tangy bursts and
            umami depth, every sauce tells its own story through texture and
            aroma. Our process doesn’t end with flavor, it begins with purpose.
            By using local produce, seasonal fruits, and traditional methods
            like lacto-fermentation and steaming, we ensure that every bottle of
            TEARS is alive with character a living expression of the ingredients
            and the land they come from.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every bottle is a limited batch, made with intent and attention, not
            mass production. We believe that flavor should move people that it
            should have emotion, memory, and depth. That’s what TEARS represents
            a feeling, a craft, and a connection between nature,
            heat, and heart.
